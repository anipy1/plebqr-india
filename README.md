# [PlebQR India](http://plebqr.in/)

Pay Indian merchants using Bitcoin Lightning Network.

A mobile application that enables users to pay Indian merchants using Bitcoin Lightning Network. Users scan a UPI QR code, enter the amount in INR, and pay via Lightning invoice. The payment is automatically converted and sent directly to the merchant's bank account.

## About

**Current Version**: This app is currently built on top of the 256d API endpoints, which uses a centralized liquidity provider for INR conversion and settlement. This is different from the original [PlebQR (Thai app)](https://plebqr.com/), which is a peer-to-peer (p2p) application where anyone can scan and anyone can pay directly.

**Future Direction**: Moving forward, PlebQR India aims to evolve towards a p2p architecture similar to the original PlebQR, enabling direct peer-to-peer Lightning payments without relying on centralized intermediaries.
